/* 
    - Using the html and js files provided, write a webpage that asks the user for input on a store, a quantity, and a product.  
    
    - Save the user input in 3 separate variables. 
        - Once the user has input their information, your webpage should console.log a sentence using those 3 variables. Using dom manipulation, you should also display the user input to the screen. For example: 'I shopped at *Target* for *5* *apples*' may be output to the console & screen. 
        
    - Do not alter the HTML doc.

    - This does not need to be styled in any sort of fashion, but feel free to if you would like!
