// What is needed for a guesing game?

// 1.  A range for our user to guess between. This should be 1-10.
// 2.  A randomized computer answer.
// 3.  A user guess that will provide a prompt
// 4.  A guess count (for loop variable declaration)
// 5.  gameLost = false


// Logic
// 1.  A way to validate the user guess
// 2.  Check if the user guess === the computer answer and alert that he / she won
// 3.  If the user guess is greater than the computer answer - nudge him or her to guess lower
// 4.  If the user guess is lower than the computer answer - nudge him or her to guess higher
// 5.  Handle the case when a user loses

// *** You will need to explore documentation on parseInt(), prompt, alert, Math.floor(), and Math.random()
